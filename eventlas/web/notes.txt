Creating new user

AppLaunches

if there is no appkey stored brings up create user
also sends api call to RegisterMobileKey

with args of timestamp and uid
this creates a key associated with uid


at same time same key is created and stored on the app

when a mobile registers a user it sends the uid & the appkey

and this allows a user to be created and when a user is created it sends back the
user info ie the userid this is stored and the api is used with this id and also
the appkey as the apikey.
