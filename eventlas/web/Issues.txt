#a log of potential issues

1. the UpdateUserEventStausController sends out mail to the inviters of an event each time the status is changed for that event
this may lead to a lot of email being sent and possibly annoying users

2. time zones
we have to make sure the times are right. at the moment the server seems to be off by a few hours
